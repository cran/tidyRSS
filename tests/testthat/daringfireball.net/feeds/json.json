(~\nis a shortcut for your home folder, the one with the house icon\nand your user name.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Apple TV<\/strong>: For TV shows and movies, the default location is\n<em>~/Movies<\/em>. Music Videos, however, will stay in the Music app.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Podcasts<\/strong>: Podcasts are stored in a cache folder in\n<em>~/Library/Group Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts<\/em>.\nThis is not designed to be user accessible, and the podcast files\ndo not display the original file names. You can, however, drag\npodcast files from the Podcasts app to the Desktop or to a folder.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I needed this because my Mac version of Podcasts had gotten screwy. I don’t really listen to podcasts using Podcasts, but I subscribe to my own show in it just to make sure it looks and works right. I usually do this checking on my iPhone, but I was taking a look at it on my Mac this week, and noticed that four episodes (#245–248) were missing from the listing of “all episodes”. My first thought was that something must be corrupt in my RSS feed for the show. My second thought, a split-second later, was, nah, it’s probably a bug in the Mac Podcasts app. My second thought was right. Those four episodes of my show were not missing in any other podcast client, including Apple Podcasts on my iPhone and iPad.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nothing I did within the Podcasts app, like unsubscribing / resubscribing, fixed the problem. The same four episodes were always missing — but only on my Mac. This reeked of a caching problem — but how to delete the cache? The Catalina Music and Movies apps continue to store their media files in the traditional, obvious places. That’s because they’re traditional Mac apps derived from the old iTunes app. I really had no idea where to look for Podcasts data to delete to try to unscrew whatever was screwed up. Trashing the folder McElhearn cites above — <em>~/Library/Group Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts<\/em> — and relaunching Podcasts did the trick. Problem solved.<\/p>\n\n<p>When I saw McElhearn’s folder name, my first thought was that he had overlooked that the “243LU875E5” part must be generated per-user, and wouldn’t be the same for everyone. It certainly looks random, right? But it’s not — that’s the name of the Apple Podcasts cache folder for everyone on Catalina, so far as I can see. Why in the world all the folders in <em>~/Library/Group Containers/<\/em> are prefixed with these ugly seemingly-random identifiers, I have no idea, but it strikes me as one more step along the path of Apple now caring less and less <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445621-when-you-re-a-carpenter-making-a-beautiful-chest-of-drawers\">about what the back of the cabinet looks like<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n    "

Since launching the App Store in 2008, Apple hasn’t\nallowed users to replace pre-installed apps such as these with\nthird-party services. That has made it difficult for some\ndevelopers to compete, and has raised concerns from lawmakers\nprobing potential antitrust violations in the technology industry.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Users have been clamoring for this ever since the App Store opened. I get why Apple has been cautious about allowing this, but at this point it’s overdue. There are third-party email clients and web browsers that are really good — Apple should celebrate that fact. And browsers will almost certainly still be required to use the system WebKit for rendering, alleviating system resource and security concerns. Chrome on iOS can’t burn through your battery like Chrome on MacOS does, because on iOS Chrome uses WebKit, not Blink.<\/p>\n\n<p>I could also see Apple doing this for email (and maybe calendars and contacts too) but <em>not<\/em> for the web browser, simply as defense against Chrome’s growing hegemony over the web. But I think the fact that Chrome on iOS must use WebKit is defense enough against that. It’s WebKit that’s worth requiring, not Safari.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now, Apple is working to allow third-party music services to\nrun directly on the HomePod, said the people. Spotify and\nother third-party music apps can stream from an iPhone or iPad\nto the HomePod via Apple’s AirPlay technology. That’s a much\nmore cumbersome experience than streaming directly from the\nspeaker.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is interesting news, because at a technical level it would seemingly require an SDK for HomePod. HomePod isn’t like Apple Watch where it’s tethered to an iOS device — it runs independently. It’s possible that Apple could just work privately with a handful of big names like Spotify and Pandora and bake support for those specific services into the HomePod OS, but I hope it’s something Apple announces at WWDC as an API for <em>any<\/em> audio app. (I’m thinking about podcast clients in particular.)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Also under discussion at Apple is whether to let users set\ncompeting music services as the default with Siri on iPhones and\niPads, the people said. Currently, Apple Music is the default\nmusic app.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Siri does support third-party apps — you just have to specify them by name: “Hey Siri, play some Pearl Jam from Spotify”. It makes sense that this should be a setting too — if you’re a Spotify user it’s a bit ridiculous that you’re currently required to tack on “from Spotify” with every single request.<\/p>\n\n<p><small>* Bloomberg, of course, is the publication that published “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack\">The Big Hack<\/a>” in October 2018 — a sensational story alleging that data centers of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China’s intelligence services. The story presented no confirmable evidence at all, was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/\">vehemently denied<\/a> by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/\">all companies<\/a> involved, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/10/22/your-move-bloomberg/?utm_term=.30e1ef835198\">has not been confirmed by a single other publication<\/a> (despite much effort to do so), and has been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/09/big-hack-doubts\">largely discredited by one of Bloomberg’s own sources<\/a>. By all appearances “The Big Hack” was complete bullshit. Yet Bloomberg has issued no correction or retraction, and seemingly hopes we’ll all just forget about it. I say we do not just forget about it. Bloomberg’s institutional credibility is severely damaged, and everything they publish should be treated with skepticism until they retract the story or provide evidence that it was true.<\/small><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-20/apple-weighs-loosening-restrictions-on-rival-iphone-music-apps\">bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-20/apple-weighs…<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n"

I don’t believe the iPad\nshould revert to its origins as a one-app-at-a-time device, but I\nknow there’s a better way forward for multitasking.<\/p>\n\n<p>My proposal for a new multitasking system employs a UI mechanic\nthat already exists across both iPhone and iPad. Without losing\nany of iPadOS 13’s current functionality, it brings the iPad\ncloser to its iPhone roots again and makes multitasking accessible\nfor the masses.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/4/#context-menus\">Context menus<\/a> are the key to a better multitasking system.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Christoffel published this two weeks ago, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since — hence the delay in my linking to it. I’m working on a longer piece about this, but in short, I think two things about this idea:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It’s very thoughtful and considered, and obviously comes from someone who gets the iPad Way, insofar as there is an iPad Way. And the design he proposes is better in every way — or at least <em>almost<\/em> every way — than what we have with iPadOS 13 today.<\/li>\n<li>It’s not good enough. Hiding everything behind contextual menus is a crutch.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>If you haven’t read Christoffel’s proposal, do so.

The following December, Google <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/google-removes-cheetah-kika-apps\">removed\none of the offending apps<\/a> but allowed Cheetah to continue\noffering other apps in the Play Store. As of this morning,\nCheetah’s entire suite of roughly 45 apps in the Play Store was\nremoved, and the apps no longer offer advertising inventory for\nsale in Google’s ad networks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Per Bjorke, Google’s senior product manager for ad traffic\nquality, told BuzzFeed News the removed apps, which had been\ninstalled more than 4.5 billion times, primarily targeted\nEnglish-speaking users and were mainly from developers based in\nChina, Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. He declined to name\nspecific apps or developers but said many of the banned apps were\nutilities or games. Google <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2020/02/disruptive-ads-enforcement-and-our-new.html\">published a blog post<\/a> today with\ndetails about the removals.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t understand why Google was so lenient with Cheetah Mobile until now. BuzzFeed News’s investigation clearly showed they were fraudsters. They hadn’t made a mistake, it wasn’t a bug or misunderstanding — they were ripping off users. Just ban them, and keep an eye out for any attempts to return under a new name. Like I’ve been advocating for Apple’s App Store, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/12/03/barnard-game-app-store\">there ought to be a bunco squad<\/a> that hunts down scams and rackets of all sorts and gets them out of the store.<\/p>\n\n<p>Google has even more leeway to be aggressive on this front, because Android allows sideloading apps. The Play Store is not the only supported way to install apps on Android devices.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/google-bans-android-apps-disruptive-ads\">buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/google-bans-android…<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n"

One simple way to describe what’s wrong with iPadOS multitasking is that it is a fundamentally modal design, and modes are generally bad.

            "content_html": "\n<p>Juli Clover, writing for MacRumors last week:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple broke California law when it failed to pay employees for\ntime spent waiting for mandatory bag searches at the end of their\nshifts, <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S243805.PDF\">the California Supreme Court ruled today<\/a>. […]<\/p>\n\n<p>Apple requires all personal packages, bags, and Apple devices that\nbelong to retail employees to be checked by a manager or security\nbefore an employee is allowed to leave the store for any reason,\nincluding breaks, lunch, and the end of shifts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Employees are also required to clock out before submitting to an\nexit search, and have estimated that the time spent waiting and\nundergoing searches ranges from five to 20 minutes. On busy\ndays, some employees have waited for up to 45 minutes waiting\nfor a bag check.<\/p>\n\n<p>Apple has argued that allowing employees to bring bags and devices\nto work is a convenience and has positioned the searches as a\n“benefit” because employees could prevent searches by not bringing\npersonal items or could be banned from bringing personal items all\ntogether. The California Supreme Court says that such a ban would\nbe “draconian” and that Apple’s arguments that employee iPhones\nare a convenience are “at odds” with how the iPhone is described\nin marketing materials.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This whole thing is an embarrassment for the richest company in the world. I can see how it happened in the first place, but once it got to court, Apple should have recognized that the policy was flatly wrong and settled it by fully paying wages for time spent in these checks to retail employees worldwide. No matter the employer, if part of your job requires time spent in a security check, you deserve to be compensated for that time.<\/p>\n\n<p>But for Apple in particular, this is absurd. First, Apple Retail stores are, square foot for square foot, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2017/07/29/apple-top-retailer-per-square-foot/\">the most profitable stores in the world<\/a>. That would still be true if they paid employees for the time spent in these security checks. Second, taking this lawsuit to the state supreme court left Apple’s lawyers arguing that employees don’t <em>need<\/em> to take their Apple devices to work. Who doesn’t take their phone to work? I literally don’t know anyone who leaves the house for anything without their phone.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/13/apple-off-the-clock-employee-bag-search-illegal/\">macrumors.com/2020/02/13/apple-off-the-clock-employee-bag…<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n"

                "name": "John Gruber"
            },
            "content_html": "\n<p>Apple press release:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our quarterly guidance issued on January 28, 2020 reflected the\nbest information available at the time as well as our best\nestimates about the pace of return to work following the end of\nthe extended Chinese New Year holiday on February 10. Work is\nstarting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a\nslower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a\nresult, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided\nfor the March quarter due to two main factors.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first is that worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily\nconstrained. While our iPhone manufacturing partner sites are\nlocated outside the Hubei province — and while all of these\nfacilities have reopened — they are ramping up more slowly than\nwe had anticipated. The health and well-being of every person who\nhelps make these products possible is our paramount priority, and\nwe are working in close consultation with our suppliers and public\nhealth experts as this ramp continues. These iPhone supply\nshortages will temporarily affect revenues worldwide.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second is that demand for our products within China has been\naffected. All of our stores in China and many of our partner\nstores have been closed. Additionally, stores that are open have\nbeen operating at reduced hours and with very low customer\ntraffic.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither of these things should be a surprise. Surely all consumer electronics companies with a manufacturing dependency upon China are affected similarly. For a U.S. company, though, Apple is unique in terms of its <em>retail<\/em> presence in China. <strong>Update:<\/strong> The issue with iPhone suppliers, I know nothing about. But I think Apple itself should have foreseen the decrease in Chinese consumer demand from this outbreak back on January 28. It seems like Apple’s executives actually believed what the Chinese government was saying about this outbreak and based their sales guidance on it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other factor I’ve been thinking about is how this outbreak might be affecting the development of future Apple products. Apple’s guidance here is solely about quarterly revenue for this January-March quarter. But Apple employees need to travel to China every day. Remember a year ago, when United Airlines accidentally leaked that Apple was their biggest client, spending $150M a year, including 50 business-class seats to China <em>every day<\/em>. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/15/united-staff-apple\">What I wrote then<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>50 seats a day between SFO and Shanghai is just a jaw-dropping\nnumber. That’s 25 Apple employees flying home and another 25\nheading over every single day.<\/p>\n\n<p>It’s possible that Apple just has a standing order for those\nseats, and some days they go unused by Apple employees. But I’ve\nheard from a few birdies who frequent the SFO-PVG route that “50\nseats a day” <em>undercounts<\/em> the number of Apple employees making\nthis trip, because it’s only counting United. They fly other\nairlines when those 50 seats are already full, and that’s not\nuncommon. They also apparently fly a ton on Cathay Pacific because\nit’s a nicer experience than United.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Those Apple employees who travel to China aren’t doing so for kicks. They have work to do there. Suppliers to meet, parts and prototypes and assembly lines to inspect. The final products are all stamped “Designed by Apple in California / Assembled in China”, but the connection between those two statements is not conducted remotely. It involves a lot of Apple’s own employees traveling to China. If that travel has been curtailed by this outbreak, it’s a problem — but a problem that has nothing to do with the next few weeks.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/02/investor-update-on-quarterly-guidance/\">apple.com/newsroom/2020/02/investor-update-on-quarterly…<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n"

A good camera alone used to cost $500-600.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are way more people on the planet who’d rather have a $1,400 phone and a $400 laptop than the other way around. But you’ll never see a tech reviewer claim that $1,000-1,400 is “hard to justify” for a laptop. It’s ridiculously out of touch to argue otherwise. And, the fact that top-of-the-line phones have reached these price points does not negate the fact that truly excellent phones are available at much lower prices.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/11/samsung-galaxy-s20-galaxy-z-flip/\">washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/11/samsung-galaxy-s20…<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n"

Hungary is a member state of the European Union and a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights. It has elections and uncensored internet. Yet Hungary is ceasing to be a free country.<\/p>\n\n<p>The transition has been nonviolent, often not even very dramatic. Opponents of the regime are not murdered or imprisoned, although many are harassed with building inspections and tax audits. If they work for the government, or for a company susceptible to government pressure, they risk their jobs by speaking out. Nonetheless, they are free to emigrate anytime they like. Those with money can even take it with them. Day in and day out, the regime works more through inducements than through intimidation. The courts are packed, and forgiving of the regime’s allies. Friends of the government win state contracts at high prices and borrow on easy terms from the central bank. Those on the inside grow rich by favoritism; those on the outside suffer from the general deterioration of the economy. As one shrewd observer told me on a recent visit, “The benefit of controlling a modern state is less the power to persecute the innocent, more the power to protect the guilty.”<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>21st century autocracy does not resemble 20th century autocracy.

I’m not going to say that the president of the United States brazenly pushing for a lighter criminal sentence for his long-time friend and co-conspirator is the worst that it can get. It’s not, and I think it’s going to get worse. But let’s stop pretending that Trump and his enablers haven’t already crossed the autocrat line.

Yet, despite fitting the MacBook Air with a 49.9 Wh\nbattery, Apple claims it will deliver just 13 hours of continuous\nvideo playback.

            "content_html": "\n<p>A brief housekeeping note. In early November, I moved this website to a new server. It had been at the old server since 2007. One small thing that broke during the move is the script I use to automatically tweet links to new DF posts from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daringfireball\">the @daringfireball Twitter account<\/a> — the DF Tootbot.<\/p>\n\n<p>What broke is fairly technical, so I’ll try to make this short. The basic gist of how the script works:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read the DF RSS feed to get a list of all current posts.<\/li>\n<li>Go through each post in the feed and see if there are entries that (a) haven’t yet been tweeted, and (b) are at least 5 minutes old. (The reason for (b) is so that I have a few minutes after initially publishing to fix any egregious mistakes or typos.)<\/li>\n<li>Upon finding an entry that meets both criteria in #2, tweet it, using the entry’s title and URL as the text of the tweet.<\/li>\n<li>Add that DF post to a history log so that it won’t get tweeted again.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The script runs once per minute as a cron job. That’s it.<\/p>\n\n<p>What broke when I moved servers was the history log. When I first wrote the script 10+ years ago, I used a database, cleverly thinking, “If this Twitter thing is here to stay, I’ll eventually tweet tens of thousands of posts, so I should use a database so lookups don’t get slow and the whole thing continues to run fast years from now.” The database I chose, unfortunately, is one that sometimes changes its underlying file format with major version updates.<sup id=\"fnr1-2020-02-06\"><a href=\"#fn1-2020-02-06\">1<\/a><\/sup> There were <em>a lot<\/em> of major version updates to Perl in the years since I last moved servers.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I could have done is just start over with a new history log on the new server, and manually fill the new database with the last few weeks of entries. For the purposes of tweeting new entries from the RSS feed, there’s no reason to keep a full historical log. The script just needs to know which <em>recent<\/em> articles — articles still in the feed — have already been tweeted.<\/p>\n\n<p>It bothered me that the script was using a database at all. It bothered me because the database wasn’t something I could just open in BBEdit and inspect and edit by hand. I’m a text file guy, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">as you may know<\/a>. Because here’s the thing: reading a simple text file log with tens of thousands of lines is really really fast on a modern computer. It would have been more than fast enough 10 years ago, and it’s much faster today.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wrote a test script and ran it against a 53 MB text file log with <em>1 million lines<\/em>. It ran in a blink of an eye. A fraction of a second. I hope to write Daring Fireball for a long time to come, but I really doubt I have a million posts in me.<\/p>\n\n<p>A database was overkill. <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth\">I ran afoul of Donald Knuth’s well-known axiom<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or\nworrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs,\nand these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative\nimpact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should\nforget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time:\npremature optimization is the root of all evil.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, I decided I should rewrite that part of the DF Tootbot to do what it should have done all along: use a simple human-readable text file for the history log. There were a few other changes I wanted to make, too — like switching from DF’s RSS feed to the <a href=\"https://jsonfeed.org/\">JSON feed<\/a> as the source for new articles, and supporting Twitter’s 280-character limit.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, I had a copy of the old version of the script on my Mac that I could run manually. Three months of procrastination later, I finally spent Monday writing the new version and getting it running on the new DF server. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daringfireball/status/1224441011524341760\">This<\/a> was the first tweet posted by the new Tootbot.<sup id=\"fnr2-2020-02-06\"><a href=\"#fn2-2020-02-06\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>In the interim, during the previous three months when @daringfireball tweets were only being triggered by me manually, the time between when I posted new items to Daring Fireball and when they got tweeted was, to put it mildly, erratic. Manually doing anything that should be automated is a bad idea for anyone, but it’s a particularly bad idea for someone with a strong tendency to think about only one thing at a time and pretty much forget everything else.<\/p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>So why do I even bother with my own custom script for posting these tweets? Indeed, there are <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">many<\/a> <a href=\"https://dlvr.it/\">services<\/a> one can use for posting new items from a blog to a Twitter account.<\/p>\n\n<p>I like having control over such things. Shocker, I know. For example, I want complete control over the exact text of the tweets. What happens, for example, when a DF post has a headline that’s too long to fit in a tweet? In that case, I want the headline to be truncated as elegantly as possible, at a whole word, with an ellipsis added to indicate the truncated words, and <em>inside<\/em> any double or single quotation marks that end the headline. With Twitter’s 2017 change from 140 characters to 280 as the upper limit of a tweet, that’s not common — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daringfireball/status/1225579433177673729\">but it can happen<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>For those of you who don’t follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daringfireball\">the @daringfireball Twitter account<\/a>, consider it. It’s a great way to see when something new or updated has been posted to DF, and with Twitter’s app, you can even get notifications of new items. (Go to the @daringfireball account profile and tap the little bell icon — you can use this to get per-account Twitter notifications from anyone.)<\/p>\n\n<p>For those of you who do follow @daringfireball, I apologize for the erratic posting schedule these last three months. It should be back to normal now, and for the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2020-02-06\">\n<p>Perl nerds only: I was using `DB_File` to <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/DB_File.html\">tie a hash with a Berkeley DB<\/a>.

            "content_html": "\n<p>Last week Jason Snell published his annual <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/01/apple-in-2019-the-six-colors-report-card/\">Six Colors Apple Report Card for 2019<\/a>. This year 65 voters (hand-selected by Snell) graded Apple in 12 areas. I was one of them, and, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/my_2018_apple_report_card\">like last year<\/a>, thought it only fair to publish my grades and remarks here at Daring Fireball. Comments in [brackets] are additional commentary I wrote now, and were not included in what I submitted to Snell.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Mac: D<\/h2>\n\n<p>This was a hard score for me to assign.<\/p>\n\n<p>My first thoughts went to hardware. We’ve got an amazing new Mac Pro that rekindles the era of workstations that offer the best performance money can buy. The best CPUs, the best SSDs, the best RAM (up to 1.5 TB!). And it’s a tremendous design accomplishment — there aren’t even any cables inside the machine. We also have a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that I think is the best notebook Apple has made in 5-6 years. It fixes everything wrong with the 15-inch MacBook Pros that preceded it — especially the keyboard.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everything isn’t perfect on the hardware front. The iMac Pro is now two years old. It’s a great machine but it hasn’t been touched in two years. That’s not pro. You can say it’s Intel’s fault because the iMac Pro is based on a line of Xeon CPUs that haven’t been updated in two years, but it’s Apple’s name on the box. The buck stops with Apple. And while the 16-inch MacBook Pro now has a totally new, totally great keyboard, it’s the most expensive model in the lineup and <em>none<\/em> of the other MacBooks have that keyboard. <em>Yet<\/em>, we all presume, but the fact is, if you buy a MacBook Air today — the best-selling, most-popular MacBook — you are not getting a good keyboard. So all things considered, I’d say a B for Mac hardware.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then I think about software. And that means thinking about MacOS 10.15 Catalina. And those thoughts are not good. Off the top of my head I’m hard pressed to think of anything in Catalina that’s an improvement over 10.14 Mojave, and I can think of a lot of things that are worse. I get it that security and convenience are at odds, and it’s a difficult job for Apple to find the balanced sweet spot between the two. But Catalina clearly bends too far in the direction of security. By design, it’s just too inconvenient, with apps generating system-level alerts prompting for permission for things as rudimentary as being able to see the files on my desktop — sometimes when those apps are in the background, and I <em>know<\/em> that at the moment the alert appears those apps are not trying to read files on my desktop. But why in the world is the desktop treated as some sort of sensitive location?<\/p>\n\n<p>Back in 2007 Apple ran a “Get a Mac” commercial <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyGUrPxG1iM\">mocking Windows Vista for this exact same sort of overzealous permission nagging<\/a>. That’s exactly what Catalina feels like.<\/p>\n\n<p>If Apple has somehow determined that typical users need these sort of permission alerts, fine, but there should be a single switch for expert users to toggle to effectively say “I trust all of the software on my Mac”. Call it “Pro Mode”, call it “Developer Mode”, call it “Expert Mode”, whatever. But I don’t know a single expert Mac user who is not seriously annoyed by the heavy-handed security design of Catalina. Not one. Every single expert user I know is annoyed. That is a bad place for MacOS to be. MacOS 10.16 needs a serious course correction to fix this, and if 10.16 goes the opposite way — growing even <em>more<\/em> heavy-handed in restricting professional Mac users from just using their machines as they want and expect to — I genuinely fear for the future of the Mac as a platform for serious computer users. Which is crazy considering that Apple just unveiled Mac Pro workstation hardware that can cost upwards of $50,000.<\/p>\n\n<p>And there are bugs in Catalina. Lots and lots of bugs. About one out of ten times that I open my new 16-inch MacBook Pro, the display contrast is horribly wrong. [Not sure if I’m on a lucky streak or if this actually got fixed, but I haven’t seen this issue in over a week.] I can “fix” it by either turning the display brightness way down and then back up, or by closing the lid and reopening it. But I’ve been using Mac laptops for 20 years and I’ve never once had an issue like that. Another paper-cut bug: turn off toolbars in Finder windows and a few minutes later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nriley/status/1218732061944688641\">the toolbars will reappear<\/a>. There are always bugs in new OS releases, and we always complain that the state of Apple’s software is too buggy. But no one can convince me that Catalina is not abnormally buggy, even now, months after release.<\/p>\n\n<p>And then there’s Catalyst. Don’t get me started.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I could give Mac hardware and software separate scores, I’d give hardware a B and software an F — not one thing about Mac software got better in 2019 and everything that did change made it worse. Where’s the Tylenol?<\/p>\n\n<h2>iPhone: B<\/h2>\n\n<p>2019 was a stellar year for iPhone hardware. I love all the iPhone 11 models. I’ve been an avid hobbyist photographer for 20 years and I happily shoot over 95 percent of my photos using my iPhone. Everything about the iPhone 11 cameras is great, from the hardware to the Camera app software. I love the new ultra-wide angle lens in all of the 11 models, and I think Apple made the right call using the ultra-wide as the only additional lens on the regular iPhone 11 (as opposed to the telephoto). My one and only significant gripe is that there’s only one size for the non-Pro iPhone 11. There ought to be a smaller one.<\/p>\n\n<p>iOS 13 is a very good release. Shortcuts are proving to be the most exciting power-user feature in the history of iOS as a platform. Sharing sheets are better than ever too. I think the overall look is getting a bit dated, though. A fair amount of Z-axis depth has been restored since the visual reboot in iOS 7, but it still feels obsessively “flat”. And parts of Apple’s iOS software feel designed only to <em>look<\/em> good, as opposed to actually <em>be<\/em> good from an interactive standpoint.<\/p>\n\n<p>[I think my Mac remarks made me grumpy — I wrote them before anything else for my report card. If I were grading the iPhone in 2019 today, I’d bump it up to an A.]<\/p>\n\n<h2>iPad: D<\/h2>\n\n<p>iPad hardware is wonderful. It seems like iPad Pro hardware is on a roughly 18-month refresh schedule, so there was nothing new in Pro hardware in 2019, but the current models are so good in every regard that that’s just fine. And the consumer models offer the best bang-for-the-buck of any computers Apple has ever sold, period. Just like with the Mac, I’d give iPad <em>hardware<\/em> an excellent score on its own, an A.<\/p>\n\n<p>But to say that I’m not a fan of iPadOS is an understatement. I wish there were a switch to force iPadOS back to the pre “multitasking” days when the iPad interaction model was “just a big iPhone” — where every app was full screen and there was no drag-and-drop. I only ever accidentally drag things like links, and I find iPadOS’s concept of “windows” to be baffling. [Turns out there sort of is such a mode in Settings → Home Screen &amp; Dock → Multitasking.] Getting the split-screen and Slide Over stuff to work is utterly unintuitive. It’s not the sort of thing you can figure out on your own just by using it, which is how the Mac user interface works. You have to know in advance how iPadOS split-screen stuff works. Just consider the fundamentals: if you want to launch an app you just tap it on the home screen or in the Dock. So far so good. But if you want a second app next to the first one, you have to drag the icon for that app out of the Dock? Why in the world would dragging an app icon launch an instance of an app? Forget about the Mac — what other platform in the world works like that? Put instances of Safari in two different “windows” — say, one split-screened with Notes and another in a “window” of its own. Then, using a hardware keyboard, Command-Tab to Safari. Which one comes forward? Toss a coin. It’s madness. I’m glad Apple started branding iOS and iPadOS separately. One of them is very cohesive, the other is incoherent. The iPadOS multitasking emperor has no clothes. I wish I could run iOS on my iPad Pro.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Apple Watch: B<\/h2>\n\n<p>Steady as she goes. I love my titanium Series 5.<\/p>\n\n<p>[I think Apple could do a much better job with watch face design. I’m not talking about allowing third-party watch faces, which, if I were in charge of Apple Watch, I wouldn’t allow either. I’m talking about Apple’s own watch faces, the only ones we can choose from.]<\/p>\n\n<h2>Wearables: A<\/h2>\n\n<p>Regular AirPods remain great and AirPods Pro are my favorite headphones ever.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Apple TV: D<\/h2>\n\n<p>No new hardware and the new Apple TV app is confusing. I’d be fine with a hardware update that did nothing but include an altogether new remote control — but a price drop would be good too. The overwhelming majority of my non-sports TV watching is done via Apple TV, and that damn remote is a daily nuisance.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Services: B<\/h2>\n\n<p>This was the year of Services for Apple — they even had a dedicated Services event. I think they mostly nailed it. The original TV series I was interested in were all good to great (<em>The Morning Show<\/em>, <em>For All Mankind<\/em>, <em>Servant<\/em>), and I think the “start with a whole year for free with the purchase of any iPhone, iPad, or Mac” promotion is just what the doctor ordered for a new service with a very limited library of content.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/02/21/apple-goldman-mastercard\">I’m still wary of Apple entering the credit card business<\/a>, period, but I use my Apple Card for all Apple Pay purchases (to get the 2 percent cash back). Daily cash back is a great feature, and Apple’s 6 percent cash back promotion for Apple Store purchases during the holiday gift season was undeniably a great deal.<\/p>\n\n<p>I’ll keep beating the drum that iCloud storage tiers are too small, though — especially the 5 GB free tier.<\/p>\n\n<h2>HomeKit/Home: C<\/h2>\n\n<p>I’ll give this whole a category a “meh”. We use it at home, mostly to control smart window shades and lights, but I think for most people, if you haven’t even really looked into it yet, I’d say you’re not missing much. I feel like Apple still hasn’t gotten close to making HomeKit truly compelling.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Hardware Reliability: A<\/h2>\n\n<p>This sort of thing is highly subjective, but everything new I’ve used this year has been rock solid.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Software Quality: C<\/h2>\n\n<p>The saving grace is iOS, by which I mean iPhone’s iOS. See my comments on Mac and iPad and Apple TV above. I’d go with a B for iOS and D for the others.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Developer Relations: C<\/h2>\n\n<p>From what I’ve seen from developer friends, App Store review times are truly excellent now — a complete change from before the reorganization that put App Store review under Phil Schiller. But when an App Store review does hit a snag, it can go completely dark (from the developer’s perspective) for a week or longer. There’s still much room for improvement here. And I continue to believe Apple should lighten up on allowing apps to at least <em>link<\/em> to websites where content purchases can be made.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Social/Societal Impact: C<\/h2>\n\n<p>It’s good for the entire world that Apple is a staunch supporter of LGBT and racial equality, serious environmentalism, privacy as a human right, and true user-controlled encryption as an aspect of privacy.<\/p>\n\n<p>It’s an absolute disgrace that Apple allowed Donald Trump to use the Mac Pro assembly plant in Austin as the backdrop for an event to promote his re-election. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/cook_trump_campaign_ad\">I called it<\/a> “a low moment in Apple’s proud history, and a sadly iconic moment for Tim Cook” when it happened, and feel just as strongly two months later. Trump is a liar, a crook, and his administration has proven to be a menace to everything Apple stands for: LGBT and racial equality, the environment, and privacy as a human right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n    "

Let me point out that I used the word “intuitive” only twice in my piece on the awkwardness of iPadOS at 10: both times referring to iOS’s “just tap an app icon to open it” interface.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most people get maybe 2% of the potential of their Macs and\nWindows PCs today. Have you watched most people use a computer\nlately? Most people I see have all apps in full screen all the\ntime, no matter how big their screen is. Most people I see use\nkeyboard shortcuts for copy and paste, opening new tabs, but\nbasically nothing else. I’ve seen numerous Mac users download\napps, open the DMG, and run the app from the DMG forever because\nthey don’t know you should move it to the Applications folder.\nMany people have a desktop full of files because the desktop is\nthe file system.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>All true. I strongly believe most people would be better off with iOS as their main computer than MacOS — including most Mac users today. It is a problem that most Mac users just store every file they have on the desktop. There is a huge opportunity on that point alone for iPadOS to surpass MacOS as the superior system for non-experts.<\/p>\n\n<p>But how many people think iPadOS has a good interface for managing files? <em>Crickets<\/em>. The Mac interface for managing files is too overwhelming for typical users to understand, but somehow iPadOS offers something worse.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As I have to say in every one of these pieces, I’m not arguing\nthat macOS is trash, nor am I arguing that iPad software is\nperfect and needs no refinement. I’m just saying that humans have\na tendency to mistake familiarity for intuitiveness.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, my criticism about iPadOS has little to do with intuitiveness. If anything, what the iPad gets right is clearly more intuitive than the Mac — direct manipulation with touch vs. indirect manipulation via mouse pointer is clearly <em>far<\/em> more intuitive and natural. That’s what makes the state of iPadOS so crushingly disappointing — it has an inherent leg up on MacOS on intuitiveness by nature of its conceptual foundation. The problems with the iPad are about <em>consistency<\/em>, <em>coherence<\/em>, and <em>discoverability<\/em>. Launching the first on-screen app with a simple tap, but the second on-screen app with a tap-and-hold-then-drag-to-the-side-but-make-sure-you-drag-it-all-the-way-to-the-side-or-else-you’ll-get-Slide-Over is inconsistent, incoherent, and requires unnecessary dexterous precision. iPadOS should be <em>less<\/em> finicky than MacOS, but all of the multitasking features are the other way around.<\/p>\n\n<p>And then there’s discoverability. Advanced iPad features are mostly invoked only by gestures — which gestures are not cohesively designed. The Mac is more complex — which is good for experts and would-be experts, but bad for typical users — but its complexity is almost entirely discoverable <em>visually<\/em>. You just move your mouse around the screen and click on things. That’s how you close any window. That’s how you put any window into or out of full-screen mode.<sup id=\"fnr1-2020-01-30\"><a href=\"#fn1-2020-01-30\">1<\/a><\/sup> Far more of iPadOS should be exposed by visual buttons and on-screen elements that you can look at and simply tap or drag with a single finger.<\/p>\n\n<p>Affordances are not clutter.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2020-01-30\">\n<p>I’ve never been a fan of full-screen mode on MacOS, and split-screen full-screen mode on the Mac is as inscrutable as on the iPad. It’s always felt bolted-on. Even the fact that the menu bar is hidden in full-screen mode is wrong. It’s trying to make the Mac into something contrary to its true nature, simply because many people want the visual simplicity of full-screen apps. Again, this is a huge missed opportunity for iPadOS, where full-screen mode is its true nature.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2020-01-30\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n    "

            "content_html": "\n<p>Ten years ago today, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLBQVKwcIDw\">Steve Jobs introduced the iPad on stage at the Yerba Buena theater in San Francisco<\/a>. It surprised everyone, in several ways. Some expected a touchscreen Mac with a stylus. Some expected a product that would do for the news industry what the iPod had done for the music industry a decade prior. Most expected a $1,000 starting price. The iPad was none of those things. It was also Jobs’s final big new product announcement.<\/p>\n\n<p>“It’s just a big iPhone” was the most common initial criticism. Turns out, “just a big iPhone” was a fantastic idea for a new product — music to tens of millions of iPhone users’ ears.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jobs’s on-stage pitch was exactly right. The iPad was a new class of device, sitting between a phone and a laptop. To succeed, it needed not only to be better at some things than either a phone or laptop, it needed to be <em>much<\/em> better. It was and is.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ten years later, though, I don’t think the iPad has come close to living up to its potential. By the time the Mac turned 10, it had redefined multiple industries. In 1984 almost no graphic designers or illustrators were using computers for work. By 1994 almost all graphic designers and illustrators were using computers for work. The Mac was a revolution. The iPhone was a revolution. The iPad has been a spectacular success, and to tens of millions it is a beloved part of their daily lives, but it has, to date, fallen short of revolutionary.<\/p>\n\n<p>iPad hardware is undeniably great. Lower-priced models are excellent consumer tablets, and are the cheapest personal computers Apple has ever made. They remain perfectly useful for many years. The iPads Pro outperform MacBooks computationally. They’re thin, light, reliable, gorgeous, and yet despite their impressive computational performance they need no fans.<\/p>\n\n<p>Software is where the iPad has gotten lost. iPadOS’s “multitasking” model is far more capable than the iPhone’s, yes, but somehow Apple has painted it into a corner in which it is far less consistent and coherent than the Mac’s, while also being far less capable. iPad multitasking: more complex, less powerful. That’s quite a combination.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider the basic task of putting two apps on screen at the same time, the basic definition of “multitasking” in the UI sense. To launch the first app, you tap its icon on the homescreen, just like on the iPhone, and just like on the iPad before split-screen multitasking. Tapping an icon to open an app is natural and intuitive. But to get a second app on the same screen, you <em>cannot<\/em> tap its icon. You must first slide up from the bottom of the screen to reveal the Dock. Then you must tap and hold on an app icon in the Dock. Then you drag the app icon out of the Dock to launch it in a way that it will become the second app splitting the display. But isn’t dragging an icon out of the Dock the way that you <em>remove<\/em> apps from the Dock? Yes, it is — when you do it from the homescreen. So the way you launch an app in the Dock for split-screen mode is identical to the way you remove that app from the Dock. Oh, and apps that aren’t in the Dock can’t become the second app in split screen mode. What sense does that limitation make?<\/p>\n\n<p>On the iPhone you can only have one app on screen at a time. The screen is the app; the app is the screen. This is limiting but trivial to understand. On the Mac you can have as many apps on screen at the same time as you want, and you launch the second, third, or <em>twentieth<\/em> app exactly the same way that you launch the first. That is consistency. On iPad you can only have two apps on screen at the same time, and you must launch them in entirely different ways — one of them intuitive (tap any app icon), one of them inscrutable (drag one of the handful of apps you’ve placed in your Dock). And if you don’t quite drag the app from the Dock far enough to the side of the screen, it launches in “<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/open-an-app-in-slide-over-ipadfe7c65e9/ipados\">Slide Over<\/a>”, an entirely different <em>shared<\/em>-screen rather than split-screen mode. The whole concept is not merely inconsistent, it’s incoherent.<\/p>\n\n<p>How would anyone ever figure out how to split-screen multitask on the iPad if they didn’t already know how to do it?<\/p>\n\n<p>On the iPhone, you always launch apps the same way: tapping their icons. On the Mac, it’s slightly more complex. In most contexts — the Dock, LaunchPad, Spotlight results — you launch apps by single-clicking them; in the Finder, however, you must double-click them. There’s a method to that seeming madness — you must double-click to open something on the Mac in any context where single-clicking will merely select that item. But the Mac’s “<em>When do I click, when do I double-click?<\/em>” issue has confused untold millions of non-expert users for decades. How many people have you seen who double-click links in a web browser? The iPhone’s simplicity eliminated this sort of confusion. No one needlessly double-taps tappable items on iPhone. The iPad, originally, shared this simplicity and clarity. When the iPad debuted it was, from top to bottom, easier to understand than the Mac, and you could learn everything there was to learn about it just by tapping and sliding to explore. It was impossible to get lost or confused.<\/p>\n\n<p>As things stand today, I get a phone call from my mom once a month or so because she’s accidentally gotten Safari into split-screen mode when tapping links in Mail or Messages and can’t get out.<\/p>\n\n<p>I like my iPad very much, and use it almost every day. But if I could go back to the pre-split-screen, pre-drag-and-drop interface I would. Which is to say, now that iPadOS has its own name, I wish I could install the iPhone’s one-app-on-screen-at-a-time, no-drag-and-drop iOS on my iPad Pro. I’d do it in a heartbeat and be much happier for it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The iPad at 10 is, to me, a grave disappointment. Not because it’s “bad”, because it’s not bad — it’s great even — but because great though it is in so many ways, overall it has fallen so far short of the grand potential it showed on day one. To reach that potential, Apple needs to recognize they have made profound conceptual mistakes in the iPad user interface, mistakes that need to be scrapped and replaced, not polished and refined. I worry that iPadOS 13 suggests the opposite — that Apple is steering the iPad full speed ahead down a blind alley.<\/p>\n\n\n\n    "

            "content_html": "\n<p>Another blockbuster security story last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince\">initially broken by Stephanie Kirchgaessner for The Guardian<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos had his mobile phone “hacked” in\n2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been\nsent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi\nArabia, sources have told the Guardian.<\/p>\n\n<p>The encrypted message from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman\nis believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the\nphone of the world’s richest man, according to the results of a\ndigital forensic analysis.<\/p>\n\n<p>This analysis found it “highly probable” that the intrusion\ninto the phone was triggered by an infected video file sent\nfrom the account of the Saudi heir to Bezos, the owner of the\nWashington Post.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two men had been having a seemingly friendly WhatsApp exchange\nwhen, on 1 May of that year, the unsolicited file was sent,\naccording to sources who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of\nanonymity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Large amounts of data were exfiltrated from Bezos’s phone within\nhours, according to a person familiar with the matter. The\nGuardian has no knowledge of what was taken from the phone or how\nit was used.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You will recall that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-national-enquirer-got-bezos-texts-it-paid-200-000-to-his-lovers-brother-11552953981\">The National Enquirer published intimate text messages and personal photographs from Bezos that revealed an extramarital affair<\/a>, which in turn led to Bezos and his wife of 25 years <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/01/09/jeff-bezos-announces-divorce-mackenzie-bezos-after-years-together/\">divorcing<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Bezos unsurprisingly launched his own investigation into how the text messages and photos had been stolen from his phone and wound up in the hands of the Enquirer. According to Bezos’s team, early evidence pointed to Saudi Arabia. That Bezos’s investigators had evidence pointing to the Saudis spooked Enquirer publisher David Pecker enough that Pecker literally attempted to extort Bezos — offering not to publish additional photos in the Enquirer’s possession in exchange for Bezos dropping his investigation. Needless to say, Bezos told Pecker to fuck off, in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">a remarkably cogent open letter<\/a> publicly revealing both the extortion scheme and Bezos’s investigative team’s suspicion that the Saudis were the culprits.<sup id=\"fnr1-2020-01-26\"><a href=\"#fn1-2020-01-26\">1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>At the time, there was much speculation as to <em>how<\/em> the Saudis hacked Bezos’s phone. Did they have agents intercepting his cellular signal? Technically possible, perhaps, especially if the text messages were SMS (we still don’t know what type of “texts” they were — we now know Bezos and MBS texted via WhatsApp, but we don’t know how Bezos and his girlfriend texted), but if the Saudis had in fact captured the information over the air, how would Bezos’s investigators ever have detected it months after the fact? <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/v74v34/saudi-arabia-hacked-jeff-bezos-phone-technical-report\">we seemingly know<\/a>. Bezos had a personal relationship with MBS and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/jeff-bezos-hack-iphone.html\">MBS personally sent Bezos the payload to exploit his phone<\/a>. The evidence is strong enough and the allegations serious enough that the United Nations <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Expression/SRsSumexFreedexAnnexes.pdf\">has issued a report on the matter<\/a>, considers it part of a pattern of human rights violations from the Saudi regime, and <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25488&amp;LangID=E\">is calling for the United States to further investigate<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>But — <em>but!<\/em> — two days ago, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors in Manhattan have evidence that The National Enquirer <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-have-evidence-bezos-girlfriend-gave-texts-to-brother-who-leaked-to-national-enquirer-11579908912\">obtained the photos from Lauren Sanchez’s brother<\/a>, who in turn was sent them from his sister’s phone. Whether Lauren Sanchez sent them to her brother, or her brother had access to her phone and sent them to his phone from her phone himself, is unclear, but the fact that <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3046795/jeff-bezos-makes-wild-fashion-statement-girlfriend-lauren\">Bezos and Sanchez are still together<\/a> suggests Bezos believes the latter. It seems entirely possible that the Saudis <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwned\">pwned<\/a> Bezos’s phone but that it was his girlfriend’s brother who betrayed them to The Enquirer. Or, more conspiratorially, perhaps her brother — a prominent Trump supporter with ties to the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/roger-stones-long-history-in-trump-world/581293/\">recently convicted felon and Trump advisor Roger Stone<\/a>, a man who describes himself as a “dirty trickster” — was in cahoots with the Saudis and the Enquirer to cover their tracks.<\/p>\n\n<p>This whole saga is extraordinary to say the least. With zero hyperbole, it sounds like the pitch for a Hollywood thriller:<\/p>\n\n<p><em>The richest man in the world — a billionaire a hundred times over — meets and exchanges phone numbers with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the most powerful dictator in the Middle East. The richest man in the world happens to own, as a mere side business, The Washington Post — a newspaper whose news coverage and opinion columns have been highly critical of the Saudi Arabian royal family’s brutal and regressive regime. The crown prince uses this superficial personal relationship with the richest man in the world to hack his phone via an infected attachment sent in a WhatsApp chat, using military-grade technology <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-phone-hacked-saudi-crown-prince-mbs-report-explained-2020-1\">seemingly created by NSO Group<\/a>, a secretive firm from Israel that supposedly only offers its services to trusted governments. Among the information the Saudis exfiltrate from the richest man in the world’s phone are text messages and intimate photos revealing an extramarital affair, which wind up published in The National Enquirer, whose publisher has long been a trusted confidant of the corrupt president of the United States, and had a stack of scandalous stories regarding said corrupt president’s own extra-marital affairs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/24/national-enquirer-kept-files-in-safe-on-trump-hush-money-payments\">locked in a safe<\/a> as part of a decades-long conspiracy to keep those scandals out of the public eye. Said corrupt president of the United States is also a vociferous critic of The Washington Post and its owner, the richest man in the world. The publication of these intimate texts and photos leads to the dissolution of the richest man in the world’s 25-year marriage, and unsurprisingly angers him, leading him to hire a team of investigators to figure out how the texts and images from his phone were stolen. A few months later a team of Saudi agents <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/europe/turkey-saudi-khashoggi-dismember.html\">brutally murders and dismembers Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi<\/a> — who was — wait for it — a journalist at The Washington Post whose columns were scathingly critical of the Saudi regime. The CIA soon determines that the Saudi hit team was acting at the direct behest of the crown prince; when informed of this, the corrupt president of the United States brushes it off with a more-or-less <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">“Shit happens, what do you expect when you criticize our friends the Saudis? Those guys play hardball.”<\/span> response.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Oh. And the corrupt president of the United States is also a nepotist. His  son-in-law is a senior White House advisor with a sprawling portfolio of responsibilities, a top-secret security clearance that was granted only because the president demanded it (<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/23/politics/kushner-whatsapp-concerns/index.html\">overriding concerns of national security officials<\/a>). Said son-in-law is known to communicate with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/23/politics/kushner-whatsapp-concerns/index.html\">via — wait for it — WhatsApp<\/a>.<sup id=\"fnr2-2020-01-26\"><a href=\"#fn2-2020-01-26\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>I take it back, this is not the pitch for a movie. It’s the pitch for a season-long TV series. My proposed title: <em>Hacked to Bits<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2020-01-26\">\n<p>Bezos, in his 2017 letter to shareholders: “We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of ‘study hall.’ ”<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea is that lazy thinking, if not outright sophistry, is easily disguised within slide decks, but narrative prose — not bullet points but a real narrative — forces the writer to think everything through. Writing is thinking, I’ve always thought, too. I frequently start a column thinking my argument is A, but as I write, I realize I was wrong and in fact my argument is Z. It’s the act of writing that forces you to think the idea through right down to the bedrock. Anyway, Bezos’s open letter revealing the Enquirer’s scheme and his suspicion that the Saudis were the culprits shows that, unsurprisingly, he’s a remarkably cogent writer. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/\">Reminds me<\/a> of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2007/02/reading_between_the_lines\">someone else<\/a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2020-01-26\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2020-01-26\">\n<p>I actually think it’s unlikely that MBS hacked Kushner’s phone. Think about it. The hack of Bezos’s phone was eventually uncovered. If he hacked Kushner, it would have come out eventually too. Trump is embarrassingly cozy with the Saudis, but he would surely be furious if it were revealed the Saudis hacked Kushner’s phone. However useful hacking Kushner’s phone would be to their intelligence gathering, it couldn’t possibly be worth spoiling their relationship with Trump. Killing and dismembering a journalist working for The Washington Post ought to outrage the president. Hacking the phone of an American citizen — any American, prince or pauper — ought to outrage the president. But hacking the phone of someone in his family actually would. Trump’s strident antipathy toward Bezos effectively served as a free pass for the Saudis to hack his phone. That the United Nations is more outraged than the United States says it all.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, still, the fact that it’s even possible that MBS did the same thing to Kushner that he did to Bezos — combined with the fact that security officials in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/23/politics/kushner-whatsapp-concerns/index.html\">were alarmed by Kushner’s use of WhatsApp all along<\/a> — is deeply concerning, to say the least.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2020-01-26\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n    "
